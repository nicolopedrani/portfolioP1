It might be natural that people who work on more projects would also work longer hours. This appears to be the case here, with the mean hours of each group (stayed and left) increasing with number of projects worked. However, a few things stand out from this plot.

1. There are two groups of employees who left the company: (A) those who worked considerably less than their peers with the same number of projects, and (B) those who worked much more. Of those in group A, it's possible that they were fired. It's also possible that this group includes employees who had already given their notice and were assigned fewer hours because they were already on their way out the door. For those in group B, it's reasonable to infer that they probably quit. The folks in group B likely contributed a lot to the projects they worked in; they might have been the largest contributors to their projects.

2. Everyone with seven projects left the company, and the interquartile ranges of this group and those who left with six projects was ~255&ndash;295 hours/month&mdash;much more than any other group.

3. The optimal number of projects for employees to work on seems to be 3&ndash;4. The ratio of left/stayed is very small for these cohorts.

4. If you assume a work week of 40 hours and two weeks of vacation per year, then the average number of working hours per month of employees working Monday&ndash;Friday `= 50 weeks * 40 hours per week / 12 months = 166.67 hours per month`. This means that, aside from the employees who worked on two projects, every group&mdash;even those who didn't leave the company&mdash;worked considerably more hours than this. It seems that employees here are overworked.
  
5. all employees with 7 projects did leave.

The scatterplot above shows that there was a sizeable group of employees who worked ~240&ndash;315 hours per month. 315 hours per month is over 75 hours per week for a whole year. It's likely this is related to their satisfaction levels being close to zero.

The plot also shows another group of people who left, those who had more normal working hours. Even so, their satisfaction was only around 0.4. It's difficult to speculate about why they might have left. It's possible they felt pressured to work more, considering so many of their peers worked more. And that pressure could have lowered their satisfaction levels.

Finally, there is a group who worked ~210&ndash;280 hours per month, and they had satisfaction levels ranging ~0.7&ndash;0.9.

Note the strange shape of the distributions here. This is indicative of data manipulation or synthetic data.

There are many observations you could make from this plot.
- Employees who left fall into two general categories: dissatisfied employees with shorter tenures and very satisfied employees with medium-length tenures.
- Four-year employees who left seem to have an unusually low satisfaction level. It's worth investigating changes to company policy that might have affected people specifically at the four-year mark, if possible.
- The longest-tenured employees didn't leave. Their satisfaction levels aligned with those of newer employees who stayed.

It appears that employees are leaving the company as a result of poor management. Leaving is tied to longer working hours, many projects, and generally lower satisfaction levels.
